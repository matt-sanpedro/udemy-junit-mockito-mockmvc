# LINUX COMMANDS USING MAVEN #
Clean lifecycle phase, ensures clean slate, prevents potential issues from outdated/conflicting files:
	mvn clean

Install lifecycle phase, compiles project, runs tests, packages code in distributable format (JAR / WAR),
then copies the resulting package into local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository):
	mvn install

To streamline both lifecyles, can execute command:
	mvn clean install

To rerun the tests, can also execute command:
	mvn test

In order to make use of the Maven tests, must ensure project contains surefire dependency in pom.xml:
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.5.3</version>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

To run Maven sure-fire reports:
	mvn site

To view Maven dependencies
	mvn dependency:tree
